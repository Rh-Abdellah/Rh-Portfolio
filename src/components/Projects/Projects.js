              description="This project features an autonomous robot built with an Arduino UNO that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and navigate through a maze. A PID controller adjusts motor speed and direction to ensure precise movement and smooth turns, allowing the robot to maintain an accurate path while solving complex maze layouts."
